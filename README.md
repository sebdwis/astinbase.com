Howdy friend or stranger, hope you're having a nice day/night.
This project doesn't really need a readme.
It's just a personal project website.

You can take a look I guess.




























It'd probably look cooler if you just went to astinbase.com.






Alternatively, if you wanna steal this project and make a competing site called astlnbase.com you're free to do that, just don't use it for phishing or malware. No one likes that.
